/**
 * Bunny Library — runtime database client (Neon PostgreSQL).
 *
 * Two Neon connection strings are used (see README → "Database"):
 *   - DATABASE_URL : Neon POOLED url  → used by this client for ALL runtime queries
 *                    (PgBouncer endpoint; serverless-safe for the Next.js runtime)
 *   - DIRECT_URL   : Neon DIRECT url  → used only by Prisma migrate/CLI commands
 *                    (versioned migrations in prisma/migrations)
 *
 * Validation is intentionally LAZY (runs on first real DB use, not at module import):
 *   - `next build` never needs database env vars (all DB-backed routes are
 *     force-dynamic), and
 *   - any wrong or missing configuration still fails LOUDLY at runtime instead of
 *     silently connecting to a wrong database.
 *
 * There is NO SQLite fallback: SQLite was removed as a runtime dependency
 * (DECISIONS.md D-28). Error messages reference variable NAMES only — never values,
 * because connection strings contain credentials.
