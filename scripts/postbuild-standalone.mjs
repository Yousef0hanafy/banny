 * Post-build: assemble the self-hostable standalone server folder.

 * `output: "standalone"` produces .next/standalone, but Next.js intentionally
 * leaves .next/static and /public OUT of it (the official docs instruct a
 * manual copy). That copy is ONLY needed when running the standalone server
 * yourself (bun run start / Docker). On Vercel the platform serves assets
 * itself, and the folder may or may not be collected — so this script is a
 * guarded no-op there instead of a hard `cp` that can fail the build.
